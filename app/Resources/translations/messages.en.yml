  NuestraHistoria: <h2>Our <span>History</span></h2>        <p>The Park of Fairs and Expositions de Rancho Boyeros, original name of the fairgrounds, emerged in the early 1930s as part of the development plan for the area where currently it is located in the town of Rancho Boyeros, was inaugurated on 23 February 1933. the division owes its origin to a house of real estate, in 1840, which was devoted to the collection of passage or right of transit vehicles circulating been built at its northern boundary on the road Real south.</p>                                <p>Desde los primeros tiempos era conocido el lugar por “El Rancho de los Boyeros” convirtiéndose posteriormente simplemente en Rancho Boyeros, lo que da lugar a su vez al nombre del reparto donde está enclavada la feria. Su alto valor arquitectónico ha hecho posible su trascendencia en el tiempo y constituyen un verdadero patrimonio arquitectónico a conservar, ejemplo del desarrollo constructivo de ese periodo. Bajo el mandato del presidente Gerardo Machado, como parte de su plan de obras públicas, en aras de crear una gran sede para las actividades relacionadas con la ganadería y actividades expositivas y que reuniera a todos los representantes de dicha rama de la isla, se comienzan a implementar exposiciones de diversos fines y así como la realización de festividades más vinculadas al sector ganadero. Pronto este acto puramente de comercio y venta, alcanzó otras connotaciones, pues constituía todo un evento para el lugar donde se efectuara, reuniendo a gran un número de personas. Por su importancia y trascendencia fue escenario de importantes eventos y encuentros nacionales e internacionales.</p>                            <p>Su construcción dotó a esta rama, de un magnífico espacio, que representaba el desarrollo y esplendor de la economía cubana de aquellos tiempos, siendo en la actualidad el Recinto Ferial permanente más antiguo del país y uno de los cinco más antiguos del continente americano.</p>
